    <h3 id="textleft">Linear Equations</h3>
    <pre>
    A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    <h2 id="formula"><span id="spm">ax+b=0</span></h2>
    Where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
    equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x
    so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an x there.
    <h3 id="textleft"><b>Quadratic Equation</b></h3>
    The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    <h2 id="formula"><span id="spm">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></h2>
    Where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
    <h3 id="textleft"><b>The area of a circle (A)</b></h3>
    &pi; (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:
    <h2 id="formula"><span id="spm">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></span></h2> 
    Or, when you know the diameter (D):
    <h2 id="formula"><span id="spm">A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></span></h2>  
    Or, when you know the circumference (C):
    <h2 id="formula"><span id="spm">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</span></h2> 
    <h3 id="textleft"><b>Intersection</b></h3>
    The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    <h2 id="formula"><span id="spm">A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</span></h2>  
    That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.
